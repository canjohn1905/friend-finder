# Friend-Finder

### About Friend Finder App

The idea was to create a Friend Finder app using Node and Express servers. The user enters the page that leads to a survey. When the user submits the survey, they are matched with a "friend" that has the closest match to their personality. It also adds the new user on the the friend list record which can be found on the botton __API Friends List__

## How it works?

On the home page you will click the `Go to Survey` button and it will take you our 10 question survey page and there you will answer 10 question with numbers from 1 being disagreed to 5 being highly agreed! After completing the surver you will click `submit` button and then your best match will pop up with an image.
